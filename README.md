# Buds Sensation Restaurant Website

Welcome to the README for the Buds Sensation Restaurant Website! In this project, I've recreated the website for Buds Sensation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, I'll provide an overview of the website structure, its features, and how to navigate through the different pages.

## Project Overview

This restaurant website consists of three main pages:

1. **Home Page (index.html)**: This page serves as the landing page for the website. It provides an introduction to Buds Sensation, highlights special offers or promotions, and invites visitors to explore the menu and make reservations.

2. **Menu Page (menu.html)**: The menu page showcases the different menus available at Buds Sensation. Visitors can browse through various categories such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, etc., and view detailed descriptions and images of each dish.

3. **Reservation Page (reservation.html)**: This page allows customers to book a reservation at Buds Sensation. It includes a form where users can enter their contact information, preferred date and time, number of guests, and any special requests.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between the different pages of the website using the navigation links provided at the top of each page.

- **Automatic Slider for Reviews Section**: JavaScript is used to implement an automatic slider for the reviews section on the home page. This feature enhances user engagement by automatically cycling through reviews at regular intervals, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.


Creating the Buds Sensation Restaurant Website was an exciting project that allowed me to showcase my skills in web development while creating a digital representation of the restaurant's ambiance and offerings.

I hope you enjoy exploring the website and experiencing the culinary delights of Buds Sensation through this digital platform!

Thank you for checking out my project!

Best regards,
